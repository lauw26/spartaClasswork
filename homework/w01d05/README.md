The game is implemented using Javascript, it uses switch statments to find the outcome of each scenario which returns either win, lose, tie or error. It uses a while loop to implement the best of 5 when one side wins their overall score is implemented by 1. The majority of the code is nested in an do while loop to allow players the opportunity to play again instead of refreshing the browser.
